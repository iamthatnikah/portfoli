# This config file is meant to be edited once, before the site is deployed.
# After that, new edits are rarely needed. 

# Usually, you need only to change `title`, `email`, `description`, `baseurl`, `url` and `date`.
# To see complete guide, please take a look into `readme.md` file.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Note #2: the configuration used in GitlabCI is generated in `.gitlab-ci.yml` file automatically for you, if you need to change that - do it there
